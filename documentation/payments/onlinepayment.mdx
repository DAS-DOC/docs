## **Accepting Payments**

Payment Options offers a flexible and secure way to accept online payments. With multiple integration methods, you can easily choose the one that best suits your business:

* **Hosted Payment Page (HPP)**: A quick and secure way to accept payments without handling sensitive data directly.

* **APIs**: For businesses that require deeper integration, our APIs for purchase and authorization give you complete control over the payment flow.

* **Website Plugins**: Ready-to-use plugins designed for popular eCommerce platforms, making it easy to start accepting payments on your website.

## **Hosted Payment Page (HPP)**

Our **Hosted Payment Page** provides a secure and customizable checkout experience. This method allows you to redirect customers to a hosted page where they can enter their payment details, ensuring PCI compliance and data security.

## **APIs for Online Payment**

For full control over your payment process, use our APIs to integrate directly with your website or application. You can integrate directly with our **PURCHASE** and **AUTHORIZATION** APIs. These APIs provide flexibility in managing transactions and allow you to create custom payment experiences.

### **PURCHASE API**

* **Purpose**: The PURCHASE API is used to initiate a one-time payment.

* **Features**: Supports various payment methods, including card and digital wallets.

* **Endpoint**: See the [Purchase API Documentation](#) for setup and usage guidelines.

### **AUTHORIZATION API**

* **Purpose**\*: The AUTHORIZATION API is used to place a hold on a specified amount without capturing it immediately, commonly used for pre-authorizations.

* **Features**: Allows you to authorize funds and capture them at a later time.

* **Endpoint**: Find details in the [Authorization API Documentation](#) for implementation instructions.

<Tip>Tip: Use the PURCHASE API for direct payments and the AUTHORIZATION API for holding funds, such as in hotel reservations or car rentals.</Tip>
