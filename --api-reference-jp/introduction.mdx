## **REST Architectural Style**

The API follows the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer), enabling efficient and predictable interactions.

* **HTTP Methods**:

  <Card title="GET Method" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET">
    Retrieve data from the server using the GET method.
  </Card>
  <Card title="POST Method" icon="circle-plus" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST">
    Create a resource on the server using the POST method.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

* **Resource-Oriented URLs**: Ensures clear and structured request handling.

## **HTTP Response Codes**

HTTP response codes indicate the status of each request:

* **200–299**: Successful responses.

* **400–499**: Client error responses.

* **500–599**: Server error responses.

## **Base URL**

All API requests are encrypted and transmitted securely over HTTPS.

* **LIVE URL**: [https://api.paymentoptions.com](https://api.paymentoptions.com)

* **Secure Communication**: Ensures sensitive data remains protected.

## **Best Practices for API Integration**

Follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth integration experience:

* **HTTP Client Compatibility**: Use clients that support RESTful APIs and authentication features.

* **Understand HTTP Methods**: Familiarize yourself with standard HTTP methods (GET, POST) to interact correctly.

* **Handle Response Codes**: Implement logic for various HTTP response codes to manage errors and debug effectively.
