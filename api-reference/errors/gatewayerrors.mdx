## **Understanding Entity Level and Product Level**

- **Entity Level**:  
  Entity-level rules apply to the merchant's operational region or the country in which the merchant operates. These settings enforce specific restrictions or policies relevant to the geographical area.  
  **Example**: Blocking transactions originating from certain card countries or IP addresses based on merchant location.  

- **Product Level**:  
  Product-level rules are specific to individual products or services within the gateway, such as "Pay by Link" or "Subscription." These rules manage product-specific behaviors and restrictions.  
  **Example**: Setting refund velocity limits or transaction thresholds for a specific product.

This distinction helps merchants and developers troubleshoot errors effectively and ensures that compliance and restrictions are properly managed across regions and products.
