### Key Points

<Info>
  * If the payload is pre-filled with data (e.g., amount, currency, customer details, return\_url, payment method), these details will be reflected on the HPP, providing a streamlined user experience.

  * If the payload lacks certain data, the customer will need to manually enter the missing information on the HPP.

  * Ensure that the necessary headers and authentication details are included to successfully generate the HPP link.
