### Key Points

<Info>
  Merchant Configuration

  * The Merchant ID for either Apple Pay or Google Pay must be included in the HPP payload when making a request to generate the payment link.

  * These payment options will automatically appear on the HPP if the merchant is properly configured for them.

  Payment Buttons

  * The HPP will dynamically display Google Pay and Apple Pay buttons based on the availability and configuration of the merchantâ€™s account.

  * Customers can seamlessly use either method to complete the transaction directly from the HPP.
