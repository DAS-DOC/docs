### Key Points

<Info>
  * The Purchase API captures the funds at the same time as it authorises them, meaning the payment is processed and completed immediately.

  * This API is ideal for transactions where the amount is fixed, and the payment must be finalized instantly, such as online retail purchases or digital goods sales.

  * After a successful purchase, the transaction can be refunded if necessary, allowing the merchant to return the funds to the customer.
