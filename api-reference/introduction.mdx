title: 'Introduction'
description: 'Welcome to the Payment Options Gateway API documentation. This API follows RESTful principles, providing a secure and efficient way for third-party software (such as acquirers or merchant websites) to interact with the Payment Options Gateway.'
---

## **REST Architectural Style**

Our API adheres to the REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style, enabling standardized and efficient communication:

- **Standard HTTP Methods**: The API uses standard HTTP methods such as **GET** and **POST** for seamless communication.
- **Resource-Oriented URLs**: Each request is structured with resource-oriented URLs, ensuring clear and predictable interactions with the API.


## **Interaction with Payment Options Gateway**

The API allows seamless interaction between third-party software (e.g., acquirers, merchant websites) and the PO Gateway through structured HTTP payloads.

- **Request and Response**: Using structured HTTP payloads, clients send requests and receive responses in a standardized format, enhancing compatibility across systems.
- **Endpoints and Resources**: The API utilizes specific resource-oriented URLs, each representing a particular resource or action within the gateway.


## **Compatibility Features**

To ensure secure and efficient operation, the **Payment Options Gateway API** includes the following compatibility features:

### **HTTP Authentication**

- **Secure Access**: The API requires secure access via HTTP authentication, ensuring only authorized users can access endpoints.

### **HTTP Verbs**

- **Standard Methods**: The API supports standard HTTP methods:
  - **GET**: Retrieve information or resources.
  - **POST**: Create new resources or perform actions.
- These methods provide a familiar and intuitive interaction model for developers.

### **HTTP Response Codes**

- **Standard Codes**: The API uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate request status:
  - **200 OK**: Request successful.
  - **404 Not Found**: The requested resource was not found.
  - **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication required or failed.
  - **500 Internal Server Error**: An error occurred on the server.
- Familiarity with these codes allows developers to handle responses effectively.

## **Base URL**

The API is accessible only over HTTPS to ensure secure communication.

- **LIVE URL**: `https://api.paymentoptions.com`
- **Secure Communication**: All API requests and responses are encrypted, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected during transmission.

## **File Downloads**

To download files through the API:

- **Direct Download URLs**: Files can be downloaded by making a GET request to the file's URL with appropriate authentication headers.
- **Download Response**: File downloads will return with:
  - Content-Type header indicating the file type
  - Content-Disposition header for the filename
  - The file content in the response body
- **Example Download URL**: `https://api.paymentoptions.com/v1/files/{fileId}/download`

## **Best Practices for API Integration**

To ensure a smooth integration experience, keep the following in mind:

- **HTTP Client Compatibility**: Ensure that HTTP clients are compatible with RESTful APIs and support necessary features like authentication.
- **Understanding HTTP Methods**: Familiarize yourself with standard HTTP methods (GET, POST) to correctly interact with the API.
- **Handling Response Codes**: Implement logic to handle different HTTP response codes, enabling effective error handling and debugging.
- **File Downloads**: When downloading files, ensure your client can properly handle binary data and respect the Content-Disposition header.
