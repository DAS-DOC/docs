## Purpose
- The API key is essential for authorisation and authentication.
- It determines whether the API will execute the request.-
- Each merchant is provided with a LIVE API KEY and an encoded key via the PO Gateway Merchant Access.

## HTTP Basic Authentication
- The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication, where the API key is passed as credentials in the Authorisation header.
- Encoding
- - HTTP Basic Authentication expects credentials to be base64 encoded.
- - Some HTTP clients automatically handle this encoding (e.g., using the -u flag with bash cURL).
- - Others may require manual encoding (e.g., using CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER in PHP cURL).

## **API Headers**

API headers provide additional metadata for each API call, including crucial information about the request and response.

| **Header**       | **Description**                                                                 |
|:-----------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `x-api-key`      | Provided along with credentials.                                                |
| `Authorization`  | Live API Key obtained from merchant details on PO Gateway. **Ensure "Basic" is included before the API key in this field** (e.g., `Authorization: Basic YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_API_KEY`). |
| `Content-Type`   | Indicates that all response attributes will be in JSON format (set to `application/json`). |

### **Important Note**
For the **Authorization** header, include **"Basic"** before the base64-encoded API key to authenticate requests properly.
