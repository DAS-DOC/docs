title: 'Postman Collection'
description: 'The Postman Collection for the Payment Options Gateway API provides a comprehensive set of pre-configured API requests that simplify testing and integration. This collection allows developers to explore and interact with the API endpoints, making it easier to understand and implement API calls.'
---

## **Purpose**

The Postman Collection includes all available API endpoints for the PO Gateway API, complete with example requests and expected responses. Using this collection, developers can:

* Test API requests with various configurations.

* Experiment with request parameters and headers.

* Simulate real API responses to validate integration.

***

## **Getting Started**

To use the Postman Collection, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the Postman Collection">
    Download the Postman Collection from the link below and import it into your Postman app.
    {/* Using the download attribute ensures the browser will download rather than navigate */}
    <a href="/downloads/PO-API-References-postman_collection.json.zip" download>Download Postman Collection</a>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Environment Variables">
    Configure environment variables in Postman for your API key, base URL, and any other required fields. This setup will allow you to test requests seamlessly across different environments (e.g., sandbox, production).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Testing">
    Begin exploring the endpoints by sending requests. Modify request parameters, headers, and body data to test various scenarios and responses.
  </Step>
</Steps>

***

## **Using the Collection**

The Postman Collection provides a structured layout for testing each endpoint:

* **Environment Variables**: The collection uses environment variables for key information like API keys, base URL, and authentication tokens. Configure these once to use across all requests.

* **Pre-configured Endpoints**: Each endpoint includes sample requests and example payloads, allowing you to explore different scenarios.

* **Request Headers and Parameters**: Each request comes with required headers and parameters pre-configured to match API specifications.

* **Example Responses**: View example responses to understand expected API outputs and error handling.

***

## **Best Practices**

* **Keep Your Environment Variables Secure**: Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys) securely within Postman's environment settings.

* **Experiment in Sandbox**: Use sandbox or test environments whenever possible to avoid affecting live data.

* **Refer to API Documentation**: Check the API documentation for details on request formats, parameters, and authentication requirements.
