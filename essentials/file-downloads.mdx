# File Downloads

To create downloadable file links in your application, you can use several approaches:

## HTML Download Attribute

The simplest way to create a downloadable link is to use the HTML `download` attribute:

```html
<a href="/path/to/file.pdf" download>Download PDF</a>
```

The `download` attribute can also specify a different filename:

```html
<a href="/path/to/file.pdf" download="custom-filename.pdf">Download PDF</a>
```

## File Types Best Practices

- Always specify the correct file type in your downloads
- Include the file size when possible to set user expectations
- Use appropriate file icons or indicators to help users identify file types

## Security Considerations

- Validate file types before allowing downloads
- Implement proper access controls for sensitive files
- Consider using signed URLs for temporary access to protected files

## Examples

### Basic Download Link
```html
<a href="/documents/sample.pdf" download>Download Sample PDF</a>
```

### Download with Custom Filename
```html
<a href="/documents/report.xlsx" download="monthly-report.xlsx">Download Monthly Report</a>
```

### Download with File Size
```html
<a href="/documents/sample.pdf" download>
  Download Sample PDF (2.5 MB)
</a>
```

## Common Use Cases

1. Document downloads (PDFs, DOCs, etc.)
2. Image downloads
3. Data file exports (CSV, Excel, etc.)
4. Software installations
5. Media files

Remember to handle errors appropriately and provide feedback to users when downloads fail or require authentication.
