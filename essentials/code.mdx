## Basic

### Inline Code

To denote a `word` or `phrase` as code, enclose it in backticks (`).

```

### Code Block

Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by enclosing code in three backticks and follow the leading ticks with the programming language of your snippet to get syntax highlighting. Optionally, you can also write the name of your code after the programming language.

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Linking Files for Download

To create a download link for files in Markdown, you can use the standard Markdown link syntax with a path to your file:

```md
[Download Example Code](path/to/your/file.zip)
```

For better user experience, you can also include the file size or type:

```md
[Download Example Code (ZIP, 2.5MB)](path/to/your/file.zip)
```

Note: Make sure your file is hosted in an accessible location and the path is correct relative to your documentation.
